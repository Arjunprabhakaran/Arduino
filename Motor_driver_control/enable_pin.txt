In most motor drivers (like L293D or L298N) youâ€™ll find three main signals for each motor:

IN1 & IN2 (or A & B) â†’ These are the control pins that decide the direction (CW/CCW/STOP).

EN (Enable pin) â†’ This controls whether the motor is active or disabled.

If EN = HIGH â†’ motor is enabled (will run according to IN1 & IN2).

If EN = LOW â†’ motor is disabled (stops regardless of IN1 & IN2).

ðŸ”Œ Connection of Enable Pin

Yes, the Enable pin can be connected to a digital pin on the Arduino.

Often, people connect it to a PWM-enabled pin (like D3, D5, D6, D9, D10, D11 on Arduino UNO).

That way, you can control the speed of the motor using analogWrite().

If you donâ€™t want speed control, you can tie EN pin directly to 5V so the motor is always enabled.



ðŸ‘‰ If you want to change the speed, just adjust the analogWrite(enablePin, value); where value = 0â€“255.
